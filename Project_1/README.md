# CS2223 - Project 1

Project Description: Design and implement a program in python to compare algorithms for determining if two strings are anagrams

How to compile and run
    1. Open the command line
    2. Go to the location of the python file
    3. Run python project1.py
    4. Follow the steps
    
Once the program is started, the first step is to enter the first string,
then you will be asked to enter the secon string, and finally to pick which algorithm to use.
The options are bf for brute force and btr for the "better" algorithm
