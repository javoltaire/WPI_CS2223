Project Description: Find the probability of a team winning a series based on the probability of winning one game

How to compile and run
    1. Open the command line
    2. Go to the location of the python file
    3. Run python project2.py
    4. Follow the steps
    
Once the program is started, you will be asked to the number of games need to win the series. That value has to be an
int to be valid, Otherwise you will be asked again until you enter a valid number. Next, you will be asked the probability
of your team of winning one game. That number has to be a float that is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, same as earlier
you will be asked again until a valid value is entered. Lastly, you will be asked to choose a method 0 for recursive and 
1 for dynamic. Once done, a message will be printed out with the probability calculated.
